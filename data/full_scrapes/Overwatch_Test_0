"[""I appreciate all the hard work and time the Overwatch team puts into creating a more fair and stable game but the new patch seems a little rough for mercy. I'm sure the team has played a lot more Mercy than my 50+ hours but I think there's still work needed. I understand the current meta is basically surrounded with Mercy but the amount of removal in this patch for her is a pretty big chunk of her ult so now when I play I don't feel any effect. I think there would be a better trade off like if her Valkyrie ressurect still has instant but can only have 1 charge. Or the other way, she can have an extra ressurect charge but with a small delay similar to her ability when not in Valkyrie.

That aside, it wasn't terrible with the reset and additional rez on her ultimate. Fine, I'll give you that one, Blizzard. But this?

"[""Okay seriously I don't even play mercy that much but I still understand that making her ult basically useless isn't how you fix the fact that you made her ult into a normal ability.
