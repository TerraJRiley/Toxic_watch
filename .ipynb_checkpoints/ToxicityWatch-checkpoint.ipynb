       "\"05/23/2016 05:44 PMPosted by DakrathAre you kidding me, Blizzard? After all the changes you made between the second and third BETA sequences, I actually thought you guys cared about balancing your game. Bastion is still WAY TOO STRONK. His turret form has way too much tankiness and range for how much absolutely insane damage he does. Yes, good job taking away his shield. He did NOT, NOT, NOT need to be able to swivel 360 unrestricted (doesn't even have to backtrack once he hits a certain point) and the speed at which he can turn means that he might as well be able to shoot in every direction. If the balance on this game isn't fixed within the first 2 weeks of release, I'm asking for a refund. Not paying for another broken game. At least not quietly.if you're still complaining about this you obviously haven't learned what countering is yet\""

While these do technically fall within the bounds of the Code of Conduct, they cover more specific examples of common errors that will lead to thread deletions or posting privileges being revoked.<br/><br/><strong>The Overwatch forums are for discussion of topics directly related to Overwatch.</strong><br/>The forums here are specifically to discuss the Overwatch beta and related topics. Any topics not related to Overwatch, Battle.net, or Blizzard Entertainment are subject to deletion.<br/><br/><strong>Don't post in all CAPS, use a misleading title, and/or excessive punctuation, etc.</strong><br/>While everyone wants their posts read, we ask you to refrain from using these types of tactics in order to bring more people to your thread. Let your post stand on its own merit. Threads violating this guideline are subject to removal.<br/><br/><strong>Don't use words like \"Blizzard,\" \"Blue,\" or any employee names in a thread topic.</strong><br/>Everyone would like Blizzard to read and acknowledge his or her post, and we understand that; however, use of such words in the subject line does not help that come to pass. Please make your thread title relevant to the post subject. Threads violating this guideline are subject to removal.<br/><br/><strong>Don't \"bump\" posts.</strong><br/>The act of posting simply to bump a thread either frequently or within short period of time is considered spamming. This also includes bumping very old threads for no reason (called \"necro bumping\" or \"necroing\").<br/><br/><strong>Petition posts are frowned upon.</strong><br/>These are discussion forums, so we ask that you hold discussions. Creating a thread to ask for replies as votes is not a discussion. Threads violating this guideline are subject to removal. <br/><br/><strong>Don't post about locked or deleted threads.</strong><br/>Posts that are moderated have a reason behind the moderation. It's up to you to read the forum Code of Conduct and these guidelines to determine what you did wrong, learn from your mistake, and attempt to post again without breaking any rules.</div> </div>\n",

While these do technically fall within the bounds of the Code of Conduct, they cover more specific examples of common errors that will lead to thread deletions or posting privileges being revoked.<br/><br/><strong>The Overwatch forums are for discussion of topics directly related to Overwatch.</strong><br/>The forums here are specifically to discuss the Overwatch beta and related topics. Any topics not related to Overwatch, Battle.net, or Blizzard Entertainment are subject to deletion.<br/><br/><strong>Don't post in all CAPS, use a misleading title, and/or excessive punctuation, etc.</strong><br/>While everyone wants their posts read, we ask you to refrain from using these types of tactics in order to bring more people to your thread. Let your post stand on its own merit. Threads violating this guideline are subject to removal.<br/><br/><strong>Don't use words like \"Blizzard,\" \"Blue,\" or any employee names in a thread topic.</strong><br/>Everyone would like Blizzard to read and acknowledge his or her post, and we understand that; however, use of such words in the subject line does not help that come to pass. Please make your thread title relevant to the post subject. Threads violating this guideline are subject to removal.<br/><br/><strong>Don't \"bump\" posts.</strong><br/>The act of posting simply to bump a thread either frequently or within short period of time is considered spamming. This also includes bumping very old threads for no reason (called \"necro bumping\" or \"necroing\").<br/><br/><strong>Petition posts are frowned upon.</strong><br/>These are discussion forums, so we ask that you hold discussions. Creating a thread to ask for replies as votes is not a discussion. Threads violating this guideline are subject to removal. <br/><br/><strong>Don't post about locked or deleted threads.</strong><br/>Posts that are moderated have a reason behind the moderation. It's up to you to read the forum Code of Conduct and these guidelines to determine what you did wrong, learn from your mistake, and attempt to post again without breaking any rules.</div>]"

Orisa spam down a choke can be much more effective at keeping attackers at bay compared to a Reinhardt just having his shield up (and having to take it down in order to fire strike). - If she dies her shield stays up. The only way Reinhardt might be better than Orisa is his slightly higher HP and his ultimate. But his ultimate is so buggy that it might not even be worth picking Reinhardt for his ultimate.

He\\'s far superior to Orisa in CQC thanks to how his hammer works and has better burst potential with Firestrike.  Earthshatter is a much better ultimate, or at least it\\'s impact is much more noticeable, since it can be used either proactively, to set up a push or ult combo, or reactively, to prevent an enemy push or ult combo, like a Beyblade. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nDuctvader\\n\\n\\n\\n529 posts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuctvader\\nIgnored \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFeb 20\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy URL\\n\\n\\n\\nView Post\\n\\nQuad Tank \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nLuci\\n\\n\\n\\n1134 posts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLuci\\nIgnored \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFeb 20\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy URL\\n\\n\\n\\nView Post\\n\\nBecause he\\'s fun and his weapon doesn\\'t feel like it\\'s a peashooter..

When Lucio wasn\\'t meta, then yeah, Orisa seems generally better. When Lucio IS meta, then a Reinhardt beats Orisa. Orisa can do a lot, but she can\\'t handle a speedboosted Reinhardt escorting his team through her shield at a supersonic speed. Additionally, a speedboosted Orisa isn\\'t quite as threatening as a speedboosted Reinhardt in direct combat. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nIXD\\n\\n\\n\\n602 posts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIXD\\nIgnored \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFeb 20\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy URL\\n\\n\\n\\nView Post\\n\\nHmm. . .Hammer Down or !@#$o. . .Hammer down. . .or. . .%^-*o. . .Hmm. . . \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nBoobo\\n\\n\\n\\n529 posts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBoobo\\nIgnored \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFeb 20\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1\\n \\n\\nCopy URL\\n\\n\\n\\nView Post\\n\\n02/20/2018 10:42 AMPosted by timotmccBetter shield mobility than orisa.

Orisa can do a lot, but she can\\'t handle a speedboosted Reinhardt escorting his team through her shield at a supersonic speed.

      "It's clear at the moment that Orisa is just superior in almost every way:- Her shield is up for much longer compared to Reinhardt.- She can shoot while the shield is up while Reinhardt can't do any damage. Orisa spam down a choke can be much more effective at keeping attackers at bay compared to a Reinhardt just having his shield up (and having to take it down in order to fire strike).- If she dies her shield stays up.The only way Reinhardt might be better than Orisa is his slightly higher HP and his ultimate. But his ultimate is so buggy that it might not even be worth picking Reinhardt for his ultimate.Does anyone else think that Rein is just really weak compared to Orisa? \n",

He's far superior to Orisa in CQC thanks to how his hammer works and has better burst potential with Firestrike.  Earthshatter is a much better ultimate, or at least it's impact is much more noticeable, since it can be used either proactively, to set up a push or ult combo, or reactively, to prevent an enemy push or ult combo, like a Beyblade. \n",

      "02/20/2018 10:35 AMPosted by PigeonIt's clear at the moment that Orisa is just superior in almost every way:- Her shield is up for much longer compared to Reinhardt.- She can shoot while the shield is up while Reinhardt can't do any damage. Orisa spam down a choke can be much more effective at keeping attackers at bay compared to a Reinhardt just having his shield up (and having to take it down in order to fire strike).- If she dies her shield stays up.The only way Reinhardt might be better than Orisa is his slightly higher HP and his ultimate. But his ultimate is so buggy that it might not even be worth picking Reinhardt for his ultimate.Does anyone else think that Rein is just really weak compared to Orisa? I like to smack idiotsinto walls for the fun of it. His ult is more fun and shield lasts longer \n",

      "Rein is far more meta than Orisa at the moment, and it essentially comes down to Lucio imo. When Lucio wasn't meta, then yeah, Orisa seems generally better. When Lucio IS meta, then a Reinhardt beats Orisa. Orisa can do a lot, but she can't handle a speedboosted Reinhardt escorting his team through her shield at a supersonic speed. Additionally, a speedboosted Orisa isn't quite as threatening as a speedboosted Reinhardt in direct combat. \n",

He is also much better in triple/quad tank because of his shield mobility.Also keep in mind that orisa becomes so good against rein only if she has hog or junk with her to break the shield. If she has dva or zarya and no junk for dps, rein can outplay the orisa because his shield likely won't go down as fast so he can pin her (when she has no shift) or easily walk past her shield and shatter everyone. \n",

He's best for pressing the enemy, and she's best for heavy defense/stalling.- His shield is mobile.  Up, down, sideways, slantways, for-ways, whatever ways!  He can adjust his shield on the fly from most directions to meet demands in the moment.  Orisa's shield is stationary for 8 seconds and demands proper placement.- Rein shield 2000 health, self generates.

      "Rein is better with zarya. So if you want grav (ex. you full held on hanamura first and you need only 1 tick), it's better to run rein. He is also much better in triple/quad tank because of his shield mobility.Also keep in mind that orisa becomes so good against rein only if she has hog or junk with her to break the shield. If she has dva or zarya and no junk for dps, rein can outplay the orisa because his shield likely won't go down as fast so he can pin her (when she has no shift) or easily walk past her shield and shatter everyone. \n",

      "- His play style favors pushing a team around them, her's is about making a   blockade around her.  I.E. He's best for pressing the enemy, and she's best for heavy defense/stalling.- His shield is mobile.  Up, down, sideways, slantways, for-ways, whatever ways!  He can adjust his shield on the fly from most directions to meet demands in the moment.  Orisa's shield is stationary for 8 seconds and demands proper placement.- Rein shield 2000 health, self generates.  Orisa shield 900 health, CD.Both have their purposes and usage, so I see both as interchangeable depending on the team needs and situations. \n",
